Here lies a journal of school coding projects and assignments I have completed at UC Berkeley. Since I can't share the source code of the projects, I'll summarize the projects and what I learned from them instead. I'll also include a link to the project spec if possible. Having a journal like this helps me keep track of the most notable projects I've completed at Berkeley!

Made an artificial neural network in RISC-V assembly. Uses Venus, a Java backend RISC-V simulator to run assembly code. Matrix and vector operations were implemented such as ReLU, argmax, and matrix multiply. Can train and classify MNIST digit dataset with greyscale images mapped with values from 0 to 255 of size 28x28 (was restircted to the integer instruction set). Uses Python unittest library to run unit and integration tests in conjucttion with the Venus simulator. Also uses bash scripts to automate development/testing workflow. It was my first project in assembly, so it was cool to see how to convert such a high level mathematical algorithm down to an option of 47 instructions that a CPU understands!

Designed a CPU with datapath, control logic, and memory fully implemented in Logisim following the RISC-V 32-bit ISA. Design scored top 100 out of 1200+ students based on how many logic gates were efficiently used. Uses Venus, a Java backend RISC-V simulator to convert assembly code to machine code and input it into Logisim. Uses Python and bash scripts to automate assembling, execution, integration tests, and development workflow. Overall, was really cool to design an actual working (virtualized) CPU and also see it run previous projects/code in RISC-V.

Scored on average top 100 out of 1200+ students out of multiple categories, scored top 10 in matrix unary/binary operations category. Uses Python C interface/API to connect C code to Python, as well as using Python unittests and CUnit testing framework to do unit and integration tests. Uses bash script to automate compilation, testing, and development workflow.
